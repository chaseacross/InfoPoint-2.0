# InfoPoint-2.0

InfoPoint in its current iteration is merely a digital version of paper media -- it's a binder with hyperlinks. InfoPoint 2.0 will be a comprehensive knowledge, QA, and interview tool: scalable, customizable, dynamic. The most important distinction between the two is that InfoPoint 2.0 affords the Member Consultant more attention to devote to the human interaction that ultimately satisfies Members beyond their immediate needs.
